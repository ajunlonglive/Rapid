How to use this file in Eclipse

Import the Rapid source into Eclipse as a Dynamic Web Project

Create a new, custom, Dynamic Web Project and copy the WebContent/WEB-INF/custombuild folder into your new project

Edit the build.properties file that you just copied over in your new project and set rapid_base to the directory of the imported Rapid sources project above.
(Windows paths need the back slashes escaped i.e. c:\\users\\)

View the properties of your new Dynamic Web Project, select "Builders", and click "New...". 
Choose "Ant Builder".
In the "Main" tab give it a useful name (like Custom build) and choose the "Browse Workspace..." button to set the "Buildfile" to this file.
In the "Targets" tab empty "After a 'Clean'" and "Manual Build". For "Auto Build" click the "Set Targets..." button and choose compile. 

To force it to do the build you might need to change a file slightly and save it. You can do so with this file. Then right click the project and choose refresh.
